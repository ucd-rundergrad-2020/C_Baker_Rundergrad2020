```

## Data discovery

**Redundant variables? Related variables? Experimental setup?**  

```{r}
head(data)
```

Looks like `group` and `condition` are redundant within `row` and `field_ID`. Also `row` is redundant within `field_ID`. 

```{r}
summary(data)
data %>% filter(genotype == "elf3") %>% summary()
```

Experimental setup appears to be four planting groups, each with all combinations of genotype (WT | elf3) and condition (sun | shade).

**Does variable parsing make sense? Is data format consistent within variables? Easier ways to parse?**   

```{r}
str(data)
```

Well, dates might be easier to work with when formatted as dates. Also, `direction` appears to have a mix of data formats.
 
**Suggestions for new variables?**    

  * Days to anthesis   
  * Days to flowering
